## Introduction

Welcome to my CS50 repository! This repository contains my coursework, projects, and solutions for Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course.

CS50 is an excellent course that covers a wide range of fundamental topics in computer science, including programming in C, algorithms, data structures, web development, and more. Throughout the course, I've learned valuable skills and tackled exciting projects that have helped me grow as a programmer.

Feel free to explore the contents of this repository and use the code as a reference or inspiration for your own projects. However, please keep in mind that academic integrity is essential, and copying the code without understanding is discouraged.
